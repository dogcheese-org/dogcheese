                    but
                    he was kicked out by the Habsburg duke of Tyrol and fled to Transylvania under the reign of
                    Goobsnobbler
                    the Fiend. The people loved his invention of dog cheese, granting him the name “Dog Cheesieus” but
                    it
                    wouldn’t be until Dog Cheesius the Great that dog cheese became a fundamental food of the people.

                    to
                    the people, II was also able to introduce small bits of dog cheese to the people, once again setting
                    his
                    son up for greatness.

                <div class="ruler-description">Dog Cheesieus the Great was the first to bring dog cheese to the people
                    like
                    Prometheus did fire. He came from the Carpathians with oodles of dog cheese of all of the first 3
                    hollowed varieties, “Carpathian Sajt”, “Tyrolean Cremig”, and “Sanctus Canis”. The people cheered
                    his
                    arrival on the white fox trotters named “Alpok” and “Kárpáti”. He gave the people dog cheese, they
                    were
                    so enthralled Dog Cheesius the Great roused them to revolt against the brutal Goobsnobbler the Fiend
                    lord of Transylvania (see more about the fight against the Fiend later on). He became King of
                    Doegkesia,
                    and was given by the people the title “Dog Cheesieus the Great”

                    Debrecen he used stealth tactics to win a battle with only 5,000 men against 13,000 without killing
                    a
                    single man, he used this non-lethal tactics so effectively and was so good to those he conquered,
                    they
                    instantly converted to Canism and fought for Dog Cheesieus, with a army that grew and grew the king
                    of
                    Hungary had no choice but to surrender.

                    general and conquered large swaths of land to the north of Doegkesia. However, he died in these
                    conquests and Doegkesia went into an era of peace for many decades until Dog “Italianus” Cheesius
                    VIII
                    expanded the nation once again.

                    Doegkesia. Tragically however, she died after the first strain of evil dog cheese seeped into her
                    pores.
